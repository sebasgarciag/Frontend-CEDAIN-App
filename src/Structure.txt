Pages

This folder should contain one folder for each page in your application. 
Inside of those page specific folders should be a single root file that is your page (generally index.js)
alongside all the files that are only applicable to that page. 
Also the hooks are made in this folders.


Components
Components folder is further broken down into subfolders. 
These subfolders are really useful since they help keep your components organized into different sections 
instead of just being one massive blob of components. 
In our example we have a ui folder which contains all our UI components like 
buttons, modals, cards, etc. We also have a form folder for form specific controls 
like checkboxes, inputs, date pickers, etc.

assets
The assets folder contains all images, css files, font files, etc. for your project. 
Pretty much anything that isnâ€™t code related will be stored in this folder.
